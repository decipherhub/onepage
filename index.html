        <h4>Decipher, Seoul Nat'l Univ. Blockchain Academy</h4>
	<p>Decipher is a blockchain Academy at Seoul National University since 2018.<br>
	We aim to make positive impact on enhancing blockchain technology and blockchain ecosystem as an academic research group.<br>
	Decipher is currently publishing articles on Medium at regular basis and planning to hold an open-seminar in coming June.<br>
	Also, there is a number of on-going projects which focus on blockchain core technology, token economy, Dapps and so on.<br>
	Our vision “Doing by Learning” serves as a compass for our Roadmap and guides us to continue achieving sustainable and quality growth.<br>
	In future, Decipher will establish academic journals to become a major blockchain academic institution.<br>

      <h4>Research Topics</h4>
      <div class="row">
	<div class="four columns"><h5>ICO 2.0</h5></div>
    	<div class="eight columns">
	  <p>The current ICO model has problems such as ineffective fund management, solely funds acquisition, and investors' risk taking. The ICO2.0 project aims to improve and implement the DAICO model proposed by Vitalik to create a formalized DAICO framework to create a healthy ICO ecosystem and to quantify the degree. Furthermore, we study what rational voting is in stake-based organizations and what motivates participants to act based on game theory.</p>

      <div class="row">
	<div class="four columns"><h5>Token Economy</h5></div>
    	<div class="eight columns">
	  <p>Although many view blockchain as a mere technology, the core of blockchain ecosystem also lies in the incentive systems. However, assuming that individuals are seeking for self-interest as in the classical economics, it is not easy to derive optimal result in such systems. Researchers in Token Economy is attempting to establish well-defined methodology(solution) for such problems. Our research goal is to propose well-organized economy model for tokens and apply our model to decentralized network.</p>

	<div class="four columns"><h5>Scalability Survey Paper</h5></div>
    	<div class="eight columns">
	  <p>Many scaling solutions (e.g. Sharding, Plasma Cash, …) are scattered around the blockchain world, but no one clearly explains how they interact with each other, how good they really are and so on.<br>
	       Thus, our team will write a scalability survey paper which includes a summary of every scaling solution, a comparative study of different solutions and finding of complementary aspects among them.</p>

	<div class="four columns"><h5>Blockchain as an IoT Platform</h5></div>
    	<div class="eight columns">
	  <p>SaaS(Software as a Service) model has been widely exploited for IoT-based context aware services as it enables efficient use of computing resources. In this project, we will expand the concept of SaaS and propose new model, BaaS (Blockchain as a Service), which offers stability and security on top of efficiency. Currently, our team is participating in several industry-based hackathons and competitions and formulating our idea for practical applications.</p>

      <div class="row">
	<div class="four columns"><h5>Virtual Machine</h5></div>
    	<div class="eight columns">
	  <p>Virtual Machine(VM) is a program to provide a platform-independent programming environment that abstracts away details of the underlying hardware or operating system and allows a program to execute in the same way on any platform. VM provides a high-level abstraction and supports high level programming languages which have features like weak type or automatic memory management. And these VMs are implemented using an interpreter and Just-in-Time(JIT) compilation.
However, VMs at Blockchains are different from traditional VMs. Especially, Ethereum Virtual Machine(EVM) only provides an interpreter but no abstraction, which does not exploit any advantages of traditional VM. WebAssembly(WASM) comes to the alternative, however, we cannot find what is the advantage to use WAM as a VM on Blockchain until now.<br>
Therefore, we’re researching VMs on Blockchain to optimize the Blockchain environments.</P>
